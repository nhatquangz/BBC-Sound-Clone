## Clone BBC Sounds Application
I've been trying to replicate BBC Sounds app with its real APIs. This project is for personal purpose only.

Currently, it has some functions such as register/login, listen, music tab, dark mode and playing view as well. I've also implemented [Compositional Layout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) - a new layout for collection view that requires iOS 13+. There are still a lot of things to do and I'll do it in my free time.

I've used violet color as the main color to differentiate this app from the original one. You can download and run using Xcode 12 or take a look at [this video](https://vimeo.com/482340251).
